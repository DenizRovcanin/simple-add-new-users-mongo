# Simple Express App with Mongo

A handy Express app that lets you add users and view them. Templating engine is Jade. For database I used Mongo with monk (https://www.npmjs.com/package/monk).

Two main routes are: `/adduser` and `/userlist`.

To start simply type `npm install` and `node app.js` in your console/terminal.
